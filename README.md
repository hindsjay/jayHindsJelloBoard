# Jello Board - A Simple Task Manager
-------------------------------------

This project was built during my time at Juno College of Technology's Immersive Web Development Bootcamp.  

The main purpose of the project was to utilize the concepts learned to build a project from scratch using React.  I decided to build a Trello clone because I felt it will help solidify the concepts learned and expose me to working through many challenges with React.  Tasks added persist using Google Firebase.  


**Version 1.0.0 - released March 4, 2020:**
-------------------------------------------
- Basic functionality (MVP) was completed which included the ability to add, edit, and delete a task
- Project is responsive and viewable at all screen sizes (will most likley look to update mobile layout - see future features note below)


**Version 1.0.1 - updated April 11, 2020**
------------------------------------------
- Refactored code to update editing task state - editing mode was not being managed in state initially. Updated components to now have editing mode for task to be managed in state.
- Added note letting user know feature to move tasks to "in progress" or "done" status is in development.  


**Future features looking to implement:**
-----------------------------------------
- Add user authentication and guest account access
- Update mobile layout --> feedback suggests there is an opportunity to update the layout for mobile.  Horizontal scroll effect does not seem to provide the kind of user experience I thought it would
- This project provides a good opportunity to gain exposure to the MERN stack
  

Project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
